1) fetch the repos and console log them 
2) get them in the browser 
3) filter out the technigo repos
4) test chart library
//Remember to pass along your filtered repos as an argument when
//you are calling this function

const getPullRequests = (repos) => {
  //Get all the PRs for each project.
  repos.forEach((repo) => {
    fetch('https://api.github.com/users/MT-dotse/repos' + repo.name + PULLS)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        //TODO
        let keep;
        if (pull.user.login === repo.owner.login) {
          keep = pull.user.login;
          commitsURL(keep);
        }
        console.log('Hello from script js');

        //1. Find only the PR that you made by comparing pull.user.login
        // with either USER or repo.owner.login
        //2. Now you're able to get the commits for each repo by using
        // the commits_url as an argument to call another function
        //3. You can also get the comments for each PR by calling
        // another function with the review_comments_url as argument
      });
